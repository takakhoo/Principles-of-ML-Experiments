# ML Lab 401: Support Vector Machines
## Overview
In this assignment, you will implement and analyze a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

In this repository, we have included a dataset, `MNIST.mat`, containing a sample of the famous MNIST benchmark. In this lab, you will develop predictive models for this data set and write a report on your findings. You will have less guidance in this lab, as you have more experience in the programming environment and we want you to have more ownership of your work. If you have questions, please reach out early and often. 

**Please read through all of the files associated with this Lab Assignment before you start the assignment.**

## Problem Statement
In this lab, you have 5 tasks, which are discussed in greater detail within the notebook `assignment-4.ipynb`. Broadly, the tasks are as follows:

1. Train a SVM to perform binary classification with non-linear kernels.
2. Implement a predictive model.
3. Compare the performance of two voting schemes.
4. Discuss your strategy for hyperparameter tuning.
5. Generate multiclass confusion matricies for your model.

## Goals of This Lab
We are asking you to complete this assignment because we want you to:

1. Gain experience constructing and analyzing SVMs.
2. Continue to practice implementing machine learning algorithms from first principles (we'll need this in hardware).
3. Practice writing succinct reports with clear figures on a complex topic.

## Expectations
You are not allowed to import an SVM from, for instance, `scikit-learn` unless specified.

You may, however, use a library (such as `scipy.optimize.minimize` or `cvxopt.solvers.qp`) for the optimization process. The code to install the `cvxopt` library is included in the first code cell, if needed. 

All lab submissions are individual and every item you submit should be a reflection of your own work. You should have ownership over the entirety of any lab you submit in this course. While your work is your own, we understand that it can be helpful in learning machine learning to collaborate with your peers, which can range from high-level discussion of a problem to debugging. Having others look at our code encourages us to write code with readability in mind. In practice, we will never work in a silo, and being able to discuss these topics with others well is a valuable skill. When you collaborate with another student, please cite them appropriately and be respectful of sharing too much. The Academic Honor Principle applies.

We respectfully ask that in the interest in furthering your own understanding of the material, that you refrain from using generative AI to code for you. Your work should be your own and you should feel comfortable justifying each design decision you make. 

Please cite any outside sources you reference.

>[!Important]
> Finally, you will get the most out of this assignment if you give yourself time to be playful and curious in your experimentation. 

## Evaluation
You will be evaluated on the quality of your code and report. Your report must provide summaries of each method's performance and some additional details of your implementation. Compare the relative strengths and weaknesses of the methods based on both the experimental results and your understanding of the algorithms.

### What to Submit
Please submit the following:

1. Your completed notebook: `assignment-4.ipynb`, where the output of each cell is clearly displayed.

2. A brief write-up that answers the 5 questions posed in this lab and justifies your model. Ensure that any figures you create are accessible and easy to understand.
