    "We are given data used in a study of the homicide rate (HOM) in Detroit, over the years 1961-1973. The following data were collected by J.C. Fisher, and used in his paper ”Homicide in Detroit: The Role of Firearms,” Criminology, vol. 14, pp. 387-400, 1976. Each row is for a year, and each column are values of a variable. A picture of the table for your reference immediately follows, but have access to the raw data in this lab.\n",

    "* FTP    - Full-time police per 100,000 population\n",
    "* UEMP   - % unemployed in the population\n",
    "* MAN    - number of manufacturing workers in thousands\n",
    "* LIC    - Number of handgun licenses per 100,000 population\n",
    "* GR     - Number of handgun registrations per 100,000 population\n",
    "* NMAN   - Number of non-manufacturing workers in thousands\n",

    "\n",
    "Use methods described in Chapter 3 of the textbook to devise a mathematical formulation to determine the third variable. Implement your formulation and then conduct experiments to determine the third variable. In your report, be sure to provide the step-by-step mathematical formulation (citing Chapter 3 as needed) that corresponds to the implementation you turn in. Also give plots and a rigorous argument to justify the scheme you use and your conclusions."
